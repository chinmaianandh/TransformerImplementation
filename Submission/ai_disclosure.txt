3. Free response: For each problem for which you used assistance, describe your overall
experience with the AI. How helpful was it? Did it just directly give you a good answer,
or did you have to edit it? Was its output ever obviously wrong or irrelevant? Did you
use it to get the answer or check your own answer?
Ans.
The AI was very helpful. I didn't ask for the code directly but If I asked, I think I would've gotten code directly. I tried to finish the assignment on my own by taking help from AI. The response was always good but sometimes missed some details which I wanted.
